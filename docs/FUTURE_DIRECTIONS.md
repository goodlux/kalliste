# Future Directions for Kalliste

## Current Architecture Reflections
The current object-oriented approach has served well for managing complex relationships between original images and crops, with clear benefits:
- Natural mapping to how photographers think about their work
- Clean handling of metadata relationships
- Flexible for experimentation and iteration
- Works well for local processing

## Alternative Architectural Approaches

### Pipeline-Based Architecture
For scaling to industrial strength applications, consider:
- Stream-based processing pipelines instead of object-oriented representations
- Main pipeline for original image processing
- Sub-pipelines for cropped region processing
- Independent scaling of different processing stages
- Tools like Apache Beam or Apache Flink for implementation

### Containerization Possibilities
Consider dockerizing components:
- ChromaDB as a separate service
- Model inference containers
- Pipeline orchestration
- API/interface layer
- Benefits: easier deployment, independent scaling, modular usage

## Challenges in the Current ML Landscape

### Model Management
- Many frameworks but complex setup requirements
- Different environments and dependencies
- Need for unified model orchestration system
- Opportunity for standardized deployment patterns

### Training Data and Pre-trained Models
- Limited availability of pre-trained models
- High barrier to entry (need for large labeled datasets)
- Duplication of effort across users
- Need for better model sharing mechanisms

## Future Opportunities

### Unified Vision Model Platform
```yaml
pipeline:
  input: 
    - type: image_directory
    - path: /photos/*
  
  stages:
    - name: face_detection
      model: insightface
      config: {...}
    
    - name: object_detection
      model: yolov8
      config: {...}
    
    - name: image_captioning
      model: blip2
      config: {...}
```

Features:
- Automated dependency management
- Model installation handling
- GPU resource management
- Environment orchestration
- Standardized pipeline execution

### Community Model Hub
Potential features:
- Pre-trained model sharing
- Collaborative model improvement
- Standardized dataset formats
- Domain-specific model collections
- Privacy-preserving model sharing

## Market Considerations
- Balance between cloud convenience and local control
- Niche but valuable market for "non-cloud" solutions
- Specialized use cases (e.g., dance photography classification)
- Copyright and privacy concerns
- Potential for federated learning approaches

## Evolution Paths
The current architecture could evolve in several directions:
1. Enhanced local tool for privacy-conscious photographers
2. Part of a larger model-sharing ecosystem
3. Bridge between local processing and selective cloud integration

## Next Steps
- Complete current bug fixes
- Release v0.0.2
- Consider containerization of ChromaDB component
- Evaluate potential for model sharing framework
- Explore specialized classifier development (e.g., dance moves)
- Consider privacy-preserving collaboration mechanisms

## Open Questions
1. Size of market for non-cloud ML photography solutions
2. Balance between sharing and copyright protection
3. Feasibility of federated learning for specialized photography domains
4. Integration possibilities with existing ML frameworks
5. Potential for standardized model sharing infrastructure
