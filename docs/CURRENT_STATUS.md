# Kalliste Development Status

## Current Work
We're implementing and testing the batch processing pipeline, with recent major improvements:

1. Implemented ModelRegistry pattern for efficient model management
2. Added comprehensive logging throughout the image processing pipeline
3. Enhanced error handling and state transition validation

## Key Files Modified:
- kalliste/image/model_registry.py (new)
- kalliste/image/batch_processor.py
- kalliste/image/batch.py
- kalliste/image/original_image.py
- kalliste/image/cropped_image.py
- kalliste/image/types.py
- scripts/test_pipeline.py

## Recent Changes:
1. Moved model initialization to BatchProcessor level via ModelRegistry
2. Added extensive logging with different levels (DEBUG, INFO, ERROR)
3. Enhanced error handling with proper context and stack traces
4. Added validation for processing status transitions
5. Improved test pipeline script with logging

## Current Issues:
- Encountered error during test run (details pending)
- Need to identify and fix the error in the next session

## Next Steps:
1. Debug and fix current test pipeline error
2. Continue testing with the new ModelRegistry setup
3. Consider adding more logging in other areas of the codebase
4. Test error handling and recovery scenarios

## Test Environment:
- Input Directory: test_images_input/
- Output Directory: test_images_output/
- Log File: pipeline_test.log
