# Kalliste Development Notes

## Current Status (Dec 25, 2024)

The core architecture has been clarified in [THIS_EXPLAINS_EVERYTHING.md](THIS_EXPLAINS_EVERYTHING.md). Recent progress and current focus areas:

### Recent Progress

1. Detection Pipeline Refinement
   - Simplified DetectionPipeline to focus solely on detection
   - Moved metadata handling to OriginalImage
   - Standardized region/tag data structures
   - Implemented face region matching with IoU calculations

2. OriginalImage Improvements
   - Added exiftool-based metadata loading
   - Implemented EXIF region matching with detected regions
   - Moved utils.py to kalliste/image/utils.py for better organization
   - Added tag association for person identification

### Current Implementation Focus

1. Image Pipeline Integration
   - Fine-tuning the flow between components
   - Testing metadata handling and region matching
   - Completing the processing pipeline
   - Working on closing gaps in implementation

2. Next Steps for Pipeline
   - Review error handling in pipeline
   - Test with various image types and metadata
   - Verify tag handling throughout process
   - Document the complete workflow

### Latest Changes (Dec 25, 2024 - Need Review)

During debugging today, we made changes to several files that may need to be reverted:

1. config.py
   - Attempted to modify YOLO model paths
   - Changed cache directory structure

2. original_image.py
   - Made detection_config optional
   - Added default detection configuration
   - Modified error handling

3. detection_pipeline.py
   - Added DEFAULT_DETECTION_CONFIG
   - Modified detection method signature
   - Updated error handling

These changes were made while debugging a TypeError related to detection_config being required in OriginalImage. We may need to revert these changes and do a fresh walkthrough of the entire codebase.

### Next Steps

1. Full Code Walkthrough
   - Review all components systematically
   - Document current implementation state
   - Note any gaps or inconsistencies
   - Plan necessary refactoring

2. Specific Focus Areas
   - Model initialization and caching
   - Configuration management
   - Error handling improvements
   - Pipeline completion

3. Complete CroppedImage Integration
   - Split functionality between services
   - Use new DetectionPipeline
   - Maintain notification chain
   - Keep as coordinator

4. SDXL Processing
   - Add size validation in RegionProcessor
   - Implement proper padding rules
   - Enforce aspect ratios
   - Follow dimensions table

5. Directory Structure
   - Add full_res and sdxl subdirectories 
   - Update file naming
   - Implement version handling
